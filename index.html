    <p>Hi, This is Swapnil. <br> The URL for my personal website has changed...
        This page now redirects to the correct url. Sorry for the inconvinience, 
        but I only recently learned how to get the *myusername*.github.io URL and believe that is a better way of doing things. 
        <br>
        <br>
        my current website url is https://swapdub.github.io/
        If you are not redirected in five seconds, <a href="https://swapdub.github.io/">click here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this page shall exist for some time until I am sure the previous link is no longer in use in public. 
        Thanks</p>
