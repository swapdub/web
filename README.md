# web
Changed personal website url. This page now redirects to the correct url. Sorry for the inconvinience, 
but I only recently learned how to get the *myusername*.github.io URL and believe that is a better way of doing things. 
<br>
<br>
my current website url is https://swapdub.github.io/
<br>
<br>
Therefore, this page shall exist for some time until I am sure the previous link is no longer in use in public. Thanks
